## Practice

Here's a component from IMDB showing opening movies this week.

- Draw out the skeleton of this app on paper.
- Write down the names of the components and whether they have state or props.

For example:
- CommentBox - State:comments
  - CommentList Props:comments
    - Comment Props:comment
    - Comment Props:comment
    - Comment Props:comment
  - CommentForm State:author, text Props:handleCommentSubmit(function)

Once you've sketched this out, implement the IMDB component in React.
